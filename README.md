# Tweakly - Bot
> Python 3.6+ | fully async | expendable

## In A Nutshell
Basically just a simple Bot to use with your own _or_ any available [Tweakly](https://github.com/mass1ve-err0r/Tweakly) instance.


Results are presented in tidy & concise _paginated_ embeds :-)

## Requirements
- discordpy
- disputils
- python-dotenv


if you're using PyCharm, cloning and opening up the project will automatically highlight missing deps which you can then install with 1-click.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
	- Change the trigger if you'd ike to (currently: `&`) 
2. Make sure you have all deps installed
3. _Also_ make sure you have a valid discord token
4. Create an `.env` file and make sure it has the following keys:
	- MAINTAINER_ID
	- TOKEN
	- API_URL
	- API_TOKEN
  
	(these should be self-explanatory)
5. Run the bot
6. Profit??
